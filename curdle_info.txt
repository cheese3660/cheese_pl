Information about curdle, and what it shall do for all parts
A) Read in the start file
B) Traverse the import tree to find a file that has an "entry" function
    Note this does not "import" the files fully, it imports them as lazy references, except the one that has the entry function
    Meaning that it will discard the parse tree if it does not find one
    The entry function must also be at the top level of the file
C) Start compilation from that entry function



Note about mixins:
    Only fully imported files (i.e.) not lazy references will have their mixins visible
    Mixins are interpreted at the same time as comptime blocks in a file
