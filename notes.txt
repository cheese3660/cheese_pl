TODO:
- Make newlines end statements in the parser, such that we can return to a normal function call and object syntax
- Have tuple literals that are different from struct literals, .{} vs .(), and also array literals .[]
- Do the same .{:TYPE} or .[:TYPE] if the type cant be inferred for the literal
- Have '...' function params that can get globbed into a tuple with the name ... basically (internally these parameters are passed as a tuple)
- figure out how to link LLVM
- internally tuples and structures are basically the same still
- still units
- interfaces
- concepts
